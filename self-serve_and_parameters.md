# Self-Serve and Parameters

Workspace parameters are the key to controlling Self-Serve and the Data Download service

**What are Parameters?**

Parameters are what control a translation.

<table style="border-spacing: 0px">
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align:middle;background-color:darkorange;border: 2px solid darkorange">
<i class="fa fa-quote-left fa-lg fa-pull-left fa-fw" style="color:white;padding-right: 12px;vertical-align:text-top"></i>
<span style="color:white;font-size:x-large;font-weight: bold;font-family:serif">Chef Bimm says…</span>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="border: 1px solid darkorange">
<span style="font-family:serif; font-style:italic; font-size:larger">
“Parameters in a translation are like
the options when making coffee.
The machine can be set with the ingredients to be used,
how they are combined, and what the end result of
the process will be like.”
</span>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

In the hierarchy of different translation components, each different level of the hierarchy has a set of parameters that belong to it.

So there are:

• Workspace Parameters
• Reader Parameters
• Writer Parameters
• Feature Type Parameters

**Published Parameters**

Published Parameters are those that have been exposed to the end-user, so they can set the values themselves. They are also called “User Parameters”.

In a self-serve application, published parameters are important to let the end user control how the data is served in terms of style and structure.
