# Notifications and Workspaces

Workspaces are what make FME Server the ideal engine for Spatial Data notifications

**Message Transformation**

As shown in the previous exercise, the simplest setup for the FME Server Notification Service is an incoming message (Publication) tagged with a specific topic that gets passed as an outgoing message to any Subscription registered with that topic:

However, that scenario does not include any transformation – restructuring – of the message contents. If the message needs to be processed in some way then an FME workspace can be employed between Publication and Subscription.

A workspace is the key functionality of FME and with one you can read spatial data from a message, in almost any format, carry out spatial transformations on that data, and then pass on the results to a set of subscribers.

This blend of live messaging with Spatial ETL is unique.

In this scenario a workspace is literally a Subscriber to the incoming Publication, and receives the message content from it. The workspace then acts as a Publisher, sending an outgoing message to any Subscribers.

Of course, the above diagram shows the full potential of a notification system. It would be just as appropriate to have a system that triggered a workspace in response to a Publication, but without the workspace sending an outgoing message:

Similarly, it’s just as appropriate to have a workspace that is run by some other means, and which sends an outgoing message to a Subscription when it is complete:

For example, a workspace might be started as a scheduled task.

When the task is complete FME sends a notification email to inform an administrator.

**Workspaces as a Subscription**

When a workspace needs to react to an incoming notification it is done by connecting the workspace to a particular topic. The workspace is run in response to that topic being triggered by a Publication.

In effect, the workspace is subscribing to that topic.

In this case the message is received and passed into the workspace for processing.

**Registering a Workspace**

A workspace is set up to receive messages when it is published to FME Server and registered with the Notification service.

The Service is initially highlighted in red because there are several parameters that need to be set before it can be used.

Two important parameters are Subscribed Topics and Notification Reader

**Subscribed Topics** tells FME which notification topics should trigger the workspace.

**Notification Reader** tells FME which Reader should receive the notification content.

In this example any incoming message that is flagged under RoadCondition will cause the workspace to run. The message content will be funneled through a plain text Reader called – appropriately enough – IncomingMessage.

**Managing Workspace Subscription**

Once a workspace is published and registered with the notification server as a subscriber it appears in the Notification section of the Web user interface.

The workspace appears as a Subscription because it is literally subscribed to the topic(s) shown.

It is listed with the protocol "push" because FME Server is pushing a notification using HTTP post to run the workspace.

Clicking on the subscription allows you to make edits to the notification without having to republish the workspace; for example topics can be added or removed.

This exercise continues setting up a system that provides email-driven access to image files. In this part we’ll create a workspace that will run in response to the incoming notification.

**1. Create a Workspace**

Now we have a Publication and a Topic that it will trigger when FME Server discovers a new email in the defined email account. However, at the moment there is nothing subscribed to that publication to act upon it. We’ll handle that part of the solution with a workspace.

Start FME Workbench. Begin with a blank canvas and simply add a Creator transformer. This will give us a workspace to run in response to an email; albeit one that doesn’t do much yet.

Save the workspace as Exercise4b.fmw

**2. Publish Workspace**

Now let’s publish the workspace to FME Server. Start the Publishing Wizard using File > Publish to Server on the menubar. When prompted enter the same connection parameters as before.
Publish the workspace to the Training repository. There are no data files that need to be published along with the workspace.

In the services dialog put a checkmark in the Notification Service’s box. Click Edit to see the Service Properties for this service.

Click the […] button next to Subscribe to Topic(s) to retrieve a list of available topics from the server.

Select the ImageProcessing topic created in exercise 4a.

All other parameters can be left as they are, so simply click OK to close the dialog.

Then click Publish to finish publishing the workspace.

**3. Confirm Subscription**

Remember, the workspace is now effectively a subscriber to the email publication. To confirm this, return to the web interface. Select Notifications from the Manage menu and then click the Subscriptions tab.

You should see a push subscription for your workspace associated with the topic ImageProcessing. Click on the subscription to view the details.

Click Cancel as we don’t need to make any changes to this component.

**4. Send an Email**

As before, send an email to trigger the notification and monitor the topic to ensure that it arrives.

**5. Confirm Notification**

To confirm the notification has caused the workspace to run, open the web interface to FME Server and click the Jobs option on the Manage menu. You should see a completed job for workspace Exercise4b.fmw, where FME ran the workspace in response to the email you just sent.

Congratulations! You have now triggered an FME Server notification using email.

**Message Content**

The ability to interpret and process message content is a key reason for using FME workspaces as a subscriber. They can receive the message and then transform it in whatever way is required.

Content is received in a workspace by a Reader.

When the workspace is run (in response to a message) the notification content is substituted in place of the source dataset for a Reader feature type, so that a feature emerges from that reader with the message content attached as an attribute.

**Content Format**

Notification content can be read by a workspace in one of the following formats:

• JSON (Javascript Object Notation)

• XML (Extensible Markup Language)

For example, here a workspace has a Reader that will receive the message content.

Notice that the above workspace uses a Text File Reader.

Reading the incoming message as plain text is the most flexible method because the message is kept intact inside a single attribute and not processed into features. It would also allow you to create one workspace that could deal with both content formats.

The message can then be scanned and processed with a number of different transformers. If the messages are in JSON format there are transformers such as the JSONExtractor and JSONFlattener. Similarly there are XMLFlattener and XMLFragmenter transformers for XML content.

**Handling Email Publications in a Workspace**

As previously described, content from a notification will be passed into the workspace to a Reader, usually a plain text Reader, and stored in an attribute.

For a JSON email the content will look like this:

{
"fns_type": "email_publisher",
"email_publisher_to": "demo@somehost.com",
"email_publisher_subject": "MIME message from sender",
"email_publisher_content{0}": "Testing Email",
"email_publisher_content_type{0}": "text/plain",
"email_publisher_from": "sender@somehost.com",
"email_publisher_received": "Thu May 17 11:15:46 PDT 2012",
"email_publisher_sent": "Thu May 17 11:15:46 PDT 2012",
"email_publisher_attachment{0}": "C:\\Temp\\demo246129673106713_canada.xsd"
}

Notice how it includes the email from and to fields, plus the content itself. If there are attachments they will be stored on the file system and a path substituted into the JSON content.

This content can be converted into FME attributes using the JSONFlattener transformer:

The result – as shown in the FME Data Inspector – will look something like this:

Now the content is available to the workspace and can be processed as required.

Having already set up a solution for incoming email notifications (in Exercise 4b) we can now expand upon that to let the user select a neighborhood in the email subject line. This neighborhood will be used to select a feature to clip the data with.

**1. Open the Starting Workspace**

In FME Workbench open the starting workspace for this exercise.

You must open this workspace as the exercise does not continue on from Exercise 4b. This workspace has more content and is similar to those created in Chapter 3; it reads and resamples raster data, clips it to a boundary, and writes it to a JPEG file.

**2. Add a Text File (TEXTLINE) Reader**

To read information into a workspace, from a notification, requires the use of a Reader. In this case we’ll use a Text File Reader.

Select Readers >Add Reader from the menubar and add a Text File reader using the following settings:

Source Format: Text File

Source Dataset: C:\FMEData2015\Resources\emailIMAP.json

Parameters:Read Whole File at Once: Yes

The Read Whole File parameter is VERY important! Click OK and OK again to add the Reader.

The file being read here is provided because all Readers need a source dataset, but also as an example of what Notification Service sends to a workspace when FME Server receives an email.

Examine the file in a text editor. It contains JSON content. You can see a number of JSON attributes available, which come from an email, and you will be able to read and use any of these in a workspace. In this exercise we’ll be using the Subject of the email.

Because you set the Parameter to read the whole file at once, all of the contents will be read into a single attribute in a single feature, rather than creating multiple features.

**3) Process the JSON Message**

Back in the workspace, connect the Text Line source feature type to the JSONFlattener already in the workspace.

Click the cog wheel icon to open the parameters dialog for the JSONFlattener.

Examine the parameters. This transformer flattens the JSON attributes into FME attributes and exposes all of them.

Browse through the rest of the workspace. It also reads a KML dataset of neighborhood polygons and then filters the neighborhood by the subject of the email to clip by that neighborhood. The UnconditionalFeatureMerger is a custom transformer (available on the FME Store) that simply merges data together without any matching key.

**4) Test the Workspace in FME Workbench**

Test the workspace by running it in FME Workbench.

This will work because the text file contains a sample email where the neighborhood is coming from the email_publisher_subject attribute. If you wish, you can edit the file and use either “Downtown” or “West End” as the neighborhood.

Inspect the output. It should look like this:

**5) Set Writer Path**

Set the JPEG writer path to the Output folder of Server Resources.

**6) Publish to FME Server (Step 1)**

Start the Publish Wizard from the menu or toolbar and enter the connection parameters when prompted. Select the Training repository to store the workspace, as usual.

Click the Select Files button in the dialog and ensure that only the KML dataset VancouverNeighborhoods.kml gets uploaded to the repository.

The easiest way to do this is to click the Files/Folders box to turn off ALL files, and then simply turn the neighborhoods file back on:

Uncheck the GeoTIFF files if they are checked because they are already available in the FME Server Repository.

However, you will still need to point the file location from the workspace to the resource location.
This is necessary because there is no end-user to set this – for example in a published parameter.

Therefore, click OK. A dialog will appear in which you are warned that the file references are not valid. For each of the Orthophoto references, click the […] ellipsis button and browse to the true file location in the resources folder.

When a reference is fixed then it will show as pointing to the resources folder; for example Data/Orthophotos/02-03-HI.tif

Once complete for all files, click OK and then click Next to go on to the next publishing stage.

**7) Publish to FME Server (Step 2)**

In the Services dialog check the Notification Service and click Edit to open the Service Properties.
Choose the topic ImageProcessing you created in the previous exercise as the Subscribed Topic.
The Notification Reader should be set to the Reader (emailIMAP[TEXTLINE]).
This way the content of any incoming email will be passed directly to that Reader.

Click OK and then Publish to complete the wizard.

**8) Send an Email to FME Server**

As before, use any method you like to send an email to your FME Server.
Use the email address you used in Exercise 4a/4b. Enter either Downtown or West End as the subject of the email.

**9) Confirm Workspace Triggered**

Again, if you are using IMAP it make may take a couple of minutes until FME Server is notified.

Open the Web User Interface and click on the Jobs link and to view the Jobs history. Look for a completed job where FME Server ran Exercise4c.fmw in response to the email. Check the Resources/Data/Output directory for your imagery.

Congratulations! Now users can email your FME Server with specific information on how to run a workspace - this is truly Self-Serve! In this next exercise you will configure FME Server to email the user back a result.

</span>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

**Email Subscriptions**

Email Subscriptions are when FME Server sends an email in response to a Topic. The in-built mail server in FME Server is only for incoming mail, and so messages need to be sent via an existing SMTP email server.

**Setting up an Email Subscription**

Creating an Email subscription is done in the Notifications section of the Web User Interface, by choosing the email protocol for a new Subscription.

Here, for example, the author has chosen the Email protocol for a new Subscription.

The Subscription is given a name and an existing topic chosen to be triggered.

There are many more parameters for outgoing mail because the full SMTP server connection parameters need to be defined.

Now when the RoadConditions_Out topic is triggered, an email is sent to recipient@example.com

However, the various fields for the email itself (From, To, Subject, Template) do not need to be hardcoded and can be passed through to the Subscription from a workspace.

One other important parameter is the Email Format.
This can either be plain text or HTML.

**Workspaces as a Publication**

When a workspace acts as a Publication, it triggers a topic when it is run.

In effect, the workspace is publishing to that topic.

In this case the message is constructed in the workspace and passed onto the Subscription.

Publishing notification messages from FME is useful for both sending messages containing content from the data being processed, and for reporting the status of a translation, such as whether it has run successfully or ended in a failure.

**Message Content**

The ability to construct message content from a variety of sources – including spatial – is a key reason for using FME workspaces as a publisher. Workspaces can transform data in multiple ways, use it to construct a message, and then dispatch that message to users as a notification.

Content is sent from a workspace by a Writer.

When the workspace is run the notification message is constructed as an attribute and sent to a Writer feature type. The output from that feature type is used by the notification service as the content of the publication.

**Content Format**

For the purposes of FME notifications, the content of a workspace publication can be in any format. It does not necessarily need to be either JSON or XML, though obviously it would have to be if any client who subscribes to the notifications requires it in that format.

For example, here a workspace constructs a plain-text weather (lightning) alert using an AttributeCreator:

Now the message attribute is connected to a Text File Writer in order to provide a means for publishing the outgoing message.

**Registering a Workspace**

Setting up a workspace to communicate notifications is achieved when the workspace is published to FME Server.

Notifications are sent once the workspace is complete. The way in which the workspace is run is not important. Notifications can be sent for workspaces run using the Job Submitter Service, or the Data Download Service, or any other service.

In other words, a workspace that sends notifications doesn’t need to be published to the Notification service; it should be published to the service under which it is to be run. Under the properties for that service will be parameters for setting the notification.

In this example the author is publishing a workspace to the Job Submitter service and has opened the properties dialog for that service. There are two parameters for controlling the topics – one for success and one for failure – and a parameter for specifying the Writer to use.

Having two Topic parameters is useful because different notifications can be sent depending on whether the workspace succeeds or fails.

In this case, when the workspace runs to completion it will trigger the RoadConditions_Out topic.
If the workspace fails to complete, it will trigger the WorkspaceFail topic.

Either way, the outgoing message is set to be output via a TextLine Writer defined in the workspace.

system administrator – for example – could subscribe to these
topics to receive notifications from all workspaces”
</span>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

**Handling Email Subscriptions in a Workspace**

As previously described, content being sent to a notification will be passed out of the workspace using a Writer, usually a plain text Writer that is passed the message in an attribute.

Therefore, to create the content requires only the construction of the attribute with transformers.

For a JSON email you would construct an attribute like this:

{
"email_to" : "notifications@enduser.com",
"email_cc" : "",
"email_from" : "notifications@fmeserver.com",
"email_replyto" : "",
"email_subject" : "Notification Subject",
"subscriber_content" : "Notification Content"
}

This could be created using an AttributeCreator transformer, where the email addresses and content can be substituted as required, and would look like this:

If the Email format is set to HTML in the Notification GUI, then the email content could be constructed as HTML too, for example:

The workspace in such a case might look like this:

**Publishing with a Transformer**

Instead of using a Writer and sending a notification at its completion, a workspace can send a notification through a special transformer called the FMEServerNotifier.

This workspace will trigger the notification wherever it is run.

Notification properties are set in the transformer parameters dialogs (it is a wizard composed of two panes)

The transformer parameters include those for connecting to FME Server, and ones for the topic to post to and the message to be included.
Here the author intends to publish the contents of an attribute called text_line_data to a topic called RoadConditionReports_Out

There are two advantages to issuing a notification this way, over using a Writer:

- The workspace can issue a notification during a translation, rather than at the end of it.

- The workspace does not need to be run on FME Server to generate an FME Server notification. It will produce the same notification when run using FME Desktop.

</span>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

**Workspaces as a Subscription AND a Publication**

A system that needs to both receive and send notifications looks like this:

In this scenario the same workspace receives an incoming notification sends an outgoing notification. It is registered with the notification service (in order to receive incoming notifications) and the notification parameters set on a different service (in order to send outgoing notifications).

For example, details of a lightning strike are received via a LightningStrike topic. The workspace then processes the information – for example it determines which state/province/county the strike occurred in – creates a new message and dispatches it to subscribers via a WeatherAlert topic.

The important thing to notice is that the scenario involves two different topics, here Topic I and Topic II.

A major problem occurs if you set up such a scenario but only use one topic.

That’s because for every notification the workspace receives it will publish back to the same topic, triggering itself again and causing an infinite loop of messages.

Having already set up a solution for incoming email notifications (in Exercise 4b) and used that information to select an area of interest (Exercise 4c) we can now expand upon that to return an email containing the data chosen by the user.

**1. Open the Starting Workspace**

In FME Workbench open the starting workspace for this exercise.

You must open this workspace as it is slightly modified from the one in Exercise 4c. A UUIDGenerator transformer and a dataset fanout has been added so that the output JPEG file has a unique name and is written to the FME Server Resources/Data/Output directory.

**2. Create an Email Topic**

Remember, it’s important for a setup like this to use different topics for incoming and outgoing notifications; otherwise the process will end up in an infinite loop.

So open the Web User Interface and click the Notifications link on the Manage menu. In the Topics tab click New to create a new Topic. Enter the name sendemail. Enter some text in the description to say “Use this topic to trigger an email using an Email Subscription”.

**3. Create an Email Subscription**

Continue in the Notifications part of the Web User Interface. Click the Subscriptions tab and then click New.

Enter EmailSender as the subscription name and choose the sendemail topic created in step 2.

**4. Enter Email Settings**

Select email as the protocol for the new subscription.

Use the table below to enter your email settings depending on your email service. Please note that if you are using your own internal email system the settings may differ and you may need to ask your IT provider.

The following settings are same regardless of email service:

Email to: <leave blank>

Email cc: <leave blank or enter an admin cc email address>

Email from: <your email address>

Email Subject: Your Data is Attached

Email Format: TEXT

Email Template: <leave blank>

We can leave some of these fields empty because they will be populated from the workspace when we send the email notification message.
Click OK to accept the settings and create the new Subscription.

**5. Add FMEServerEmailGenerator**

Back in FME Workbench, click on the workspace canvas and start typing “FMEServer” to locate and add an FMEServerEmailGenerator transformer.

This is a Custom Transformer that will be downloaded from the FME Store – as denoted by the small arrow on its icon in the Quick Add dialog.

The transformer is designed to be a quick and easy way to set up an outgoing email.

**6. Connect Custom Transformer**

Connect the newly placed custom transformer on a new connection from the UUIDGenerator: DO NOT connect it between the UUIDGenerator and the Writer feature type. We’ll shortly add a new Writer to connect it to.

**7. Set Transformer Parameters**

Click on the red cog-wheel icon to open the parameters dialog for the FMEServerEmailGenerator transformer. As you’ll see, there are many parameters to help us create the JSON message we will be sending to the email Subscription.

The important parameters should be set as follows:

**To:** This value depends on whether you are using IMAP or SMTP to send your email to FME Server. Click the drop-down arrow to the right and select Attribute Value > clipper_email_publisher_from or clipper_imap_publisher_from. This attribute contains the address the incoming email was received from and therefore should be used for who the outgoing email will be sent to.

**Attachments:** Click the drop-down arrow to the right and select Open Text Editor. This value will be slightly more complex than an attribute and we need to construct it with an editor such as this.

Enter the following into the text editor field: $(FME_SHAREDRESOURCE_DATA)/Output/@Value(_uuid)/AirphotoMosaic.jpg

This tells FME to use the data created by the JPEG writer as an attachment to the outgoing email message. Click OK to close the dialog.

The other fields can be set as follows:

CC: blank

From: blank

Reply to: blank

Subject: Your Image Order is Attached

Message: Please find attached the image you requested.

Note that the blank parameters will come from the Email Subscription we set up in Step 1

**8. Add a Notification Writer**

Having created the email to send we now need to add a Writer to pass it to the Notification service.

Select Writers > Add Writer from the menubar. Create a writer with the following parameters:

Writer Format: Text File

Writer Dataset: C:\FMEData2015\Output\Email.json

Once added, connect the FMEServerEmailGenerator transformer to the new feature type.
The transformer automatically generates the text_line_data attribute required by this Writer.

**9. Publish the Workspace (Step 1)**

This workspace is the heart of a system of incoming and outgoing notification messages; therefore it needs to be published to FME Server as both a Publication and Subscription!

As always, start the Publish Wizard, enter the connection parameters, and choose the Training repository to store the workspace.

As in Exercise 4c, click the Select Files button to ensure that the VancouverNeighborhoods.kml file will be uploaded to the repository, and that the image data is not.

Again as in Exercise 4c, click OK and then – when warned about invalid references – for each of the Orthophoto references, click the […] ellipsis button and browse to the true file location in the resources folder.

**10. Publish the Workspace (Step 2)**

In the Services dialog check the Notification Service and click its Edit button.
Again select ImageProcessing as the Subscribed Topic, and set the Notification Reader to the email[TEXTLINE] Reader.

In the same Edit Service Properties dialog scroll down and expand the Notify on Job Completion settings.

Set Topics to Publish (Success) to the sendemail topic you previously created.

Set the Notification Writer should be set to your Email[TEXTLINE] Writer.

Leave Topics to Publish (Failure ) blank, but notice this is where you could handle a failure in workspace if you wanted to.

Click OK and then Publish to complete the wizard.

**11. Send an Email to FME Server**

Again send an email to your FME Server using the email address you have been using, and entering either Downtown or West End as the subject of the email.

After a minute or two you will receive an email back with the image attached. The image will be an orthophoto clipped to the neighbourhood you entered in the subject line.

Congratulations! Without writing any code you have set-up an email ordering system for imagery.
