# Deploying FME Server

FME Server can be deployed in a number of configurations 

**Platforms**

FME Server can be deployed on a variety of platforms:

• **Local Infrastructure (Physical Hardware)**
This is the traditional platform where you purchase FME Server and install it on your own hardware systems.

• **Infrastructure as a Service (Virtual Hardware)**
This is where you purchase FME Server and install it on virtual hardware that is provided as service by a company such as Amazon.

•** Platform as a Service (FME Cloud)**
This is where FME Server is delivered pre-installed on an Amazon virtual computer, with the whole platform provided by Safe Software on a pay-as-you-go basis.

**Distributed Systems**

A distributed system is when different components of a system are located on separate, networked, computers.

In a distributed environment, FME Engines run on a computer or computers that are separate from the FME Server host. Administrators can configure the FME Engines to register with a failover FME Server host, which acts as a backup if the primary FME Server host fails.

Other failover mechanisms include an additional core and license server.
