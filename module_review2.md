# Module Review

This module introduced you to running workspaces on FME Server.
**
What You Should Have Learned from this Module**

The following are key points to be learned from this module.

**Theory**

• FME Server is a Model Driven Architecture – where workspaces are the models

• FME Desktop (particularly FME Workbench) is the authoring tool for FME Server workspaces

• FME workspaces are published from Desktop to Server and stored on FME Server in repositories

• Data (and other related files) can be uploaded and stored on FME Server as “Resources”.
The output from a translation can be written to a Resources folder too.

• The Job Submitter service is for running a workspace “as-is” 

**FME Skills**

• Publish a workspace from FME Workbench to FME Server, creating a new repository if
necessary

• Upload source data to a Resources folder on FME Server

• Run a workspace on FME Server – either through the web interface or via a URL – that makes use of datasets in a Resource folder

• Examine the results of the translation to see if it was successful
