# What is FME Server?

FME Server is a powerful product for handling large volumes of data at the enterprise level.

**FME Server Summarized**

FME Server is a powerful product for handling large volumes of data at the enterprise level. It has three core capabilities: Self-Serve, Real-Time, and Automation.

**Self-Serve**

Self-Serve is the ability for the end-user to select and download the data they require, in the format and structure they require; or to upload data for validation. It eliminates the need for a data manager/analyst to carry out manual data distribution tasks.

**Real-Time**

Real-Time is the ability to react to real-time events and sensors, to carry out immediate updates, and to deliver instant notifications. It allows subscribers to have the most up-to-date information for their business decision making.

**Automation**

Automation is the ability to carry out data processing at a specific schedule, and to spontaneously move data through different systems and web services – even onto mobile platforms and devices.
It allows data to move from anywhere, to anywhere, without manual intervention.

**FME Server vs FME Desktop**

FME Server expands on the local processing tools of FME Desktop by providing the same core data translations and transformations, but at an enterprise level, and with the above enterpriselevel capabilities.

With these capabilities, FME Server can take advantage of a huge variety of different communication technologies. This means it can provide many different ways to:
• Start a workspace
• Structure a translation
• Deliver the output

FME Server does not include an authoring tool, so FME Desktop is used to create these workspaces.

The focus of this course is how to create these workspaces in ways that will take full advantage of FME Server’s enterprise capabilities.
