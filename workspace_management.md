# Workspace Management

Because Workbench is a client of FME Server, workspaces may be transferred to and from an FME Server repository.

**Transferring Workspaces**

FME Workbench has the ability to:

• Publish a workspace to FME Server
• Republish a workspace to FME Server
• Download a workspace from FME Server

These three capabilities are accessed in FME Workbench either through the menubar…


…or the toolbar:


<table style="border-spacing: 0px">
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align:middle;background-color:darkorange;border: 2px solid darkorange">
<i class="fa fa-quote-left fa-lg fa-pull-left fa-fw" style="color:white;padding-right: 12px;vertical-align:text-top"></i>
<span style="color:white;font-size:x-large;font-weight: bold;font-family:serif">Professor Lynn Guistic says…</span>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="border: 1px solid darkorange">
<span style="font-family:serif; font-style:italic; font-size:larger">
“Published workspaces are held on FME Server in a file-based
repository. Each FME Server may have multiple repositories, but any
workspace can only belong to one of them.
All metadata related to the workspace is held separately in FME Server’s
repository database. This metadata includes information about source
and destination datasets, workspace feature types, and published
parameters.”
